# AlgorithmicMazeRunner
This is the README for my Algorithmic Maze Runner project completed during my summer internship at Boeing with my partner.

This repo contains 3 .py files:
  the main.py file with the main method,
  the motors.py file with the object-oriented design of the 2 motors,
  the sensors.py file with the object-oriented design of the 3 ultrasonic sensors.
